# Data Modeling with PostgreSQL

## Description

The dataset used in this project has been collected from songs and users activities
on a streaming music app. The purpose is to analyze data and understand what
songs users are listening to.   
For this reason, I'm going to build an ETL pipeline that will transfer data
from JSON files in two local directories into a postgres database using python
and SQL. But before writting the ETL pipeline, I'm going to define fact and
dimension tables for a star schema. Then I'm going to build an entity relationship
diagram that represents my data model.
